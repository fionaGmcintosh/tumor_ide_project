\section{Abstract}

This project implements a comprehensive comparison between classical Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models and Impulsive Differential Equation (IDE) models for tumor growth with radiation therapy, based on the methodology from Laleh et al. (2022). The analysis demonstrates that IDE models, which incorporate discrete radiation therapy sessions as impulses, consistently outperform ODE models, which model treatment as continuous effects on growth parameters, when fitted to real patient data.

\section{Introduction}

Mathematical modeling of tumor growth has become crucial for understanding cancer progression and optimizing treatment strategies. Classical models have been widely used in the field, but their validation against real patient data has been limited. This project addresses this gap by implementing and comparing six classical tumor growth models in both ODE and IDE formulations.

\subsection{Research Question}

Does modeling radiation therapy as discrete impulses (IDE) provide better predictive accuracy than modeling it as a continuous effect (ODE) when fitted to real patient data?

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Models Implemented}

Six classical tumor growth models were implemented:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Exponential}: $\frac{dy}{dt} = ry$
    \item \textbf{Logistic}: $\frac{dy}{dt} = ry(1 - \frac{y}{K})$
    \item \textbf{Classic Bertalanffy}: $\frac{dy}{dt} = ay^{2/3} - by$
    \item \textbf{General Bertalanffy}: $\frac{dy}{dt} = ay^m - by^n$
    \item \textbf{Classic Gompertz}: $\frac{dy}{dt} = ry\ln(\frac{K}{y})$
    \item \textbf{General Gompertz}: $\frac{dy}{dt} = ry\ln(\frac{K}{y})^{1/m}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{ODE vs IDE Formulations}

\subsubsection{ODE Models}
ODE models incorporate treatment as a continuous effect on growth parameters:
\begin{align}
\text{Exponential ODE: } \frac{dy}{dt} &= (r - \text{treatment\_effect}) \cdot y \\
\text{Logistic ODE: } \frac{dy}{dt} &= (r - \text{treatment\_effect}) \cdot y(1 - \frac{y}{K})
\end{align}

\subsubsection{IDE Models}
IDE models incorporate treatment as discrete impulses at treatment times:
\begin{align}
\frac{dy}{dt} &= f(t, y, \text{params}) \quad \text{(between treatments)} \\
y(t^+) &= y(t^-) \cdot (1 - \text{impulse\_strength}) \quad \text{(at treatment times)}
\end{align}

\subsection{Two Experiments}

Following Laleh et al. (2022), two experiments were conducted:

\subsubsection{Experiment 1: Goodness of Fit}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use ALL available data points from each patient
    \item Fit both ODE and IDE models to complete dataset
    \item Measure Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) against observed data
    \item Question: "Which model best describes the data we have?"
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Experiment 2: Early Prediction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use only first 50\% of data points for fitting
    \item Predict remaining 50\% of data points
    \item Measure Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predictions
    \item Question: "Which model best predicts future outcomes from early data?"
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Software Architecture}

The project consists of several Python modules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{tumor\_models.py}: Core model implementations using scipy
    \item \texttt{simple\_demo.py}: Basic demonstration with 3 models
    \item \texttt{correct\_ode\_ide\_comparison.py}: Single experiment analysis
    \item \texttt{two\_experiments\_comparison.py}: Complete two-experiment analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Generation}

Synthetic patient data was generated to simulate real clinical measurements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 101 daily measurements over 100 days
    \item 40 radiation therapy sessions (5 days/week for 8 weeks)
    \item Realistic treatment effects and measurement noise
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Visualization of Model Predictions}

Figure \ref{fig:model_comparison} shows the experimental data overlaid with both ODE and IDE model predictions for all six classical tumor growth models. The visualization clearly demonstrates:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Experimental Data} (black dots): Synthetic patient measurements with realistic noise
    \item \textbf{ODE Predictions} (red dashed lines): Continuous treatment modeling
    \item \textbf{IDE Predictions} (blue solid lines): Discrete impulse modeling
    \item \textbf{Treatment Times} (gray vertical lines): Radiation therapy sessions
\end{itemize}

The plots show that IDE models (blue lines) consistently follow the experimental data more closely than ODE models (red dashed lines), particularly during the treatment period (days 20-76).

\subsection{Experiment 1: Goodness of Fit}

Table \ref{tab:exp1} shows the RMSE results for all models when fitted to complete patient data.

\end{table}
